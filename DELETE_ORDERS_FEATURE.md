4. Handles errors

**Uses SQL:**
```sql
-- Delete all order items
DELETE FROM order_items 
WHERE id != '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';

-- Delete all orders
DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE id != '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### **When to Delete All Orders:**

   - Clear test orders after development
   - Reset database for demo
   - Clean slate for new features

2. **End of Period**
   - Archive old orders (if implemented)
   - Start fresh for new season
   - Clean up after data migration

3. **Data Management**
   - Remove corrupted data
   - Clear duplicate entries
   - Fresh start after system issues

### **⚠️ When NOT to Delete:**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### **1. Individual Delete Buttons**

Add delete button to each order in the list:

```typescript
// In order row:
<button 
  onClick={() => handleDeleteOrder(order.id)}
  className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700"
>
  <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4" />
</button>
```

---

### **2. Bulk Select & Delete**

Allow selecting multiple orders:

- "Delete Selected" button
- Select all functionality

---

### **3. Archive Instead of Delete**

Add archive feature:

- Filter to show/hide archived orders

```typescript
const archiveOrder = async (orderId: string) => {
  await supabase
    .from('orders')
    .update({ archived: true })
    .eq('id', orderId);
};
```

---

### **4. Export Before Delete**

Automatically export orders before deleting:

- Download archive
- Then proceed with deletion

---

### **5. Soft Delete with Recovery**

Implement soft delete:
- Mark as deleted instead of removing
- 30-day recovery period
- Permanent deletion after period

```

---

## 📝 Database Impact

### **What Gets Deleted:**

- Payment details
- Order timestamps
- Order status
